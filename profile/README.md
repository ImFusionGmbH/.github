## Tutorials & Demos for the ImFusion SDK

To get started, we recommend to check out one of the following repos:
* [public-demos](https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/public-demos) for small example projects that can be built against the C++ ImFusion SDK. These projects are either standalone applications that demonstrate integrating the ImFusion SDK into custom applications or plugins that demonstrate how to extend the SDK with new functionality.
* [public-python-demos](https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/public-python-demos) for demos highlighting the capabilities of our Python integrations (extend the ImFusion Suite with Python algorithms, or use the ImFusion algorithms from Python)
* [public-ultrasound-demos](https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/public-ultrasound-demos) for demo datasets and accompanying workspace files that showcase core functionalities of the ImFusion Ultrasound plugin.


You will also find information in our [documentation](https://docs.imfusion.com) and tutorial videos on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ImFusionGmbH).
